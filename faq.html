<p class="question">
    When can I work?
</p>
<p class="answer">
    Each day is divided into mostly 2 hours shifts so you can sign up on-line for any that you choose.   We try to have two people on a shift especially at busy times.

<p class="question">
    Do I need to work the same shifts each week?
</p>

    A few people do a regular shift but most people find it more convenient to pick slots week by week.  There is no commitment!
