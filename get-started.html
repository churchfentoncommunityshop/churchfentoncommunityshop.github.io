    <p class="quote">"Each journey begins with a single step" - Lao Tzu</p>
    <p>Why not make this the day when you start you journey into volunteering?  You will discover many benefits, make new friends and do something worthwhile for your community </p>
    <p>The best way to get started is by visiting the shop and talking to one of our volunteers.  If you prefer to set up a time then email <a href="volunteers@thecfcshop.co.uk">volunteers@thecfcshop.co.uk</a>
        and we will arrange that
    </p>
    <p>We will show you around and explain the kind of things that you could get involved in</p>
    <p>The next step would then be to try a session working with other volunteers to get a better feel for what it is like</p>
    <p><img src="images/volunteers2.jpg" class="float_right" alt="group of volunteers">At no point do you need to make a firm commitment - we will show you how to sign up on the rota so eventually you are free to pick any shifts (mostly 2 hours) that suit you</p>
    <p>Then try one or two shifts working alongside other volunteers</p>
    <p>That's it!</p>
