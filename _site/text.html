<p>We're a friendly group of volunteers who enjoy coming together to make a difference and have a good time. Our team is a great way to meet new people and make connections with others you might not have otherwise had the chance to meet. Plus, the work we do is enjoyable and satisfying. To top it all off, we have regular social events like Christmas parties and summer fayres where we can celebrate and relax with our friends.

<p>If you're interested in volunteering with us, you'll be happy to know that most of our training is done on the job. This means that you'll have the opportunity to work closely with an experienced volunteer who can guide you through the process and help you get up to speed. It's a great way to learn and gain hands-on experience in a supportive and welcoming environment. We hope you'll consider joining us!.</p>

If you're between 14 and 18, there are some items that you won't be able to sell, but don't worry! You can still volunteer with us in other roles or work alongside someone else. We're just happy to have you on board and contribute your time and talents to our team

        <p>
            The Queens Award for Volunteering is a prestigious award that recognises individuals and groups who have demonstrated exceptional commitment to volunteering in their local community. It is a way to say thank you to the volunteers who have made a significant difference in their community through their time and effort. The award was presented to us by the Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire, Jo Ropner, on behlf of the Queen and is considered one of the highest honours that can be bestowed upon volunteers.
        </p>

            Winners of the award are presented with a certificate signed by The Queen and a Crystal Trophy. 
            Being a recipient of the Queens award for volunteering is a great honour and recognition of the hard work and dedication of our volunteers. It is a testament to the impact that we can have on our community through selfless acts of kindness and generosity.
