    Our volunteers are the heart and soul of the shop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being a completely volunteer run enterprise makes our shop a special place with an outstanding ethos of
    friendliness, care, support, and pride in what we do.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have volunteers from all kinds of backgrounds, from 14 years to well over 80s…each one is valued and appreciated.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are so many ways you can volunteer at the shop, from serving behind the counter to filling shelves, helping
    with accounts and book-keeping, gardening, cleaning, ordering, weighing produce, tidying, …. the list is endless.
    Each and every task completed helps to keep our shop serve the community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The great thing about volunteering is that you usually get as much out of it as you put in…win, win!!
  </p>
  <p>
    Volunteers tell us how much they love the time they spend in the shop, and how they feel connected to their
    community and have got to know their neighbours. So many have formed new friendships (we’ve even had two marriages
    of couples who met in the shop!)
  </p>

  <p>These are some of the things our team have said about their volunteering:
  </p>
  <div class="row background-dark">
    <p> "I feel much more part of the village"</p>
    <p> "I've met so many freindly people"</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    …and these are some of the things our customers say about the service we provide.
  </p>
  <div class="row background-light">
    <p>"It is wonderful to always be greeted by a smiling face"</p>
    <p>"The range of products is so wide and many are locally sourced"</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    As well as getting to know people while working, we also arrange volunteer socials which are a great way to meet
    more of the volunteers who you might not cross paths with.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our young volunteers volunteering presents a great work experience opportunity where young people can get a
    taste of working life in a friendly and supportive environment. They learn lots of skills…great for the CV or UCCAS
    form!
  </p>

  <p>
    We do DBS checks for all our volunteers which allows us to have under 18s working in the shop. We have grant funding
    for these.
  </p>

  <p>
    Volunteering with us is very flexible and can be on an ad hoc basis. You don’t need to make a regular commitment,
    but you can sign up ahead to a particular shift if you prefer. We have an App for organising the rota for counter
    shifts which is easy to use and lets you decide exactly when you would like to work. For other roles, such as
    filling shelves, cleaning, gardening, its fine to just pop in when you have a bit of spare time, even if its just
    half an hour…you’ll always get a welcome!
  </p>

  <p>
    You will receive any training you need, all quite straightforward, and you can take it as fast or as slow as you
    like. We always make sure that newer volunteers have an experienced volunteer working alongside them. Don’t let the
    till put you off if you’re a bit of a technophobe…despite all its beeping and random messages, it’s simpler than it
    looks, and you can always leave that bit to someone else if you don’t fancy it!
  </p>

  <p>
    Since we opened, we have collectively done 10s of thousands of hours of voluntary work…over 20,000 behind the till
    alone!
  </p>

  <p>
    In June 2022 we were awarded the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service. This is awarded to CFCS as a group for “an
    outstanding contribution to society” and is something we are all extremely proud of.
