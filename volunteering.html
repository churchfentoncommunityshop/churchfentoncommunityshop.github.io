    <p>Every day, millions of people across the UK are making a difference by volunteering</p>
    <p>Each year, outstanding examples of this work are celebrated through the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service (QAVS). Created in 2002 for the Queen’s Golden Jubilee, QAVS awards have been shining a light on the fantastic work of voluntary groups for many years</p>
    <p>Equivalent to an MBE, QAVS are the highest awards given to local voluntary groups in the UK, and they are awarded for life</p>

    <p>You can imagine how excited we were to be nominated - local assessors researched us and visited the groups before writing a report on our suitability</p>
    <p>The local assessment panel decided to put us forward to the National Assessment Committee who included us on a shortlist for approval by the Queen</p>
